### 1.2 Interpretation

In these Terms (including the introduction and schedules) unless the context otherwise requires:

(a) reference to a person includes a legal person (such as a limited company) as well as a natural person;

(b) reference to these Terms includes the schedules and appendices and other documents attached to it or incorporated by reference into it (all as amended, added to or replaced from time to time);

(c) references to clauses or schedules shall be to those in or to these Terms and references to paragraphs shall be to paragraphs of the schedules or annexes to the schedules (as the case may be);

(d) clause headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction of these Terms;

(e) reference to "including" or any similar terms in these Terms shall be treated as being by way of example and shall not limit the general applicability of any preceding words; and

(f) reference to any legislation shall be to that legislation as amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time and to any subordinate provision made under that legislation.

## 2. Basis of terms

### 2.1

These Terms are framework terms further to which the parties may enter into a License Quotation in respect of Services to be provided by the Licensor to the Licensee.

### 2.2

Each such License Quotation once agreed in accordance with clause 2.3, shall constitute a separate contract for the provision of the Services specified in such Quotation, incorporating these Terms.

### 2.3

The Licensor will only provide Services to the Licensee further to a Quotation. No Quotation shall be binding on either party unless and until agreed by both parties.

### 2.4

All Quotations entered into with the Licensee will be subject to the terms set out in these Terms. No terms or conditions endorsed upon, delivered with or contained in any quotation, estimate, correspondence, acknowledgement or acceptance of order or any similar document issued by the Licensee shall form part of any contract between the Licensor and the Licensee.

### 2.5

In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of these Terms and the terms of any Quotation, the terms of the relevant Quotation shall prevail only to the extent of any such conflict or inconsistency.

### 2.6

Requests for License Quotations must be made by email to admin@infinite-table.com

## 3. Provision of Licensed Materials and Support Services

### 3.1

The Licensor shall make the Licensed Materials available in Source Code form at https://github.com/infinite-table/infinite-react on the first Quotation Effective Date by provision of an activation key required to access the Licensed Materials, subject to payment of the Fees.

### 3.2

Subject to clause 3.3 below, the Licensor grants to the Licensee a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license (in the form of a Developer License), commencing on the relevant Quotation Effective Date, to permit Licensee Developers to use the Licensed Materials in accordance with these Terms, subject to the limit on the number of permitted Licensee Developers set out in the relevant Quotation. Members within the group of Licensee Developers can be replaced with alternative members as long as the number of concurrent Licensee Developers at any time does not exceed the limit set out in the relevant Quotation. For the purposes of this limit, each developer modifying JavaScript code as part of the creation of an Application's user interface or Modification of a user interface shall constitute a separate Licensee Developer. For example, if the Licensee has seven developers working with JavaScript code on an Application, but only three developers directly working with the Software, all seven developers will be counted as Licensee Developers.

### 3.3

The Licensee may use the Licensed Materials to install, load, launch, access, run, execute, operate, and archive the Licensed Materials for production, test, archival, emergency re-start and disaster recovery purposes and to develop and create derivative works from the Licensed Materials in the form of Applications, provided that:

(a) the Licensee shall not permit any end user of any Application to use the Software independently of, or by or with any applications other than, the Application being used by that end user.

### 3.4

In the event that the Licensee creates any Modifications to the Source Code to the Software, the Licensor shall not be obliged to provide the Support Services in relation to any such Modification(s) from the date on which any such Modification(s) take place.

### 3.5

The Licensee shall not change or remove the copyright notice from any of the files included in the Licensed Materials.

### 3.6

The Licensee shall not redistribute the Licensed Materials or any Modifications other than as expressly permitted by these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee shall not redistribute the Licensed Materials or any Modifications:

(a) other than by including the Software or a portion of the Software within Application(s); and

(b) as part of any Application that can be described as a development toolkit or library, an application builder, a website builder, a user interface designer, or any application that is intended for use by software, application, or website developers or designers, or has a similar purpose or functionality (as determined by the Licensor).

### 3.7

Subject to clause 3.3, the Licensor will provide the Support Services to the Licensee Developers in accordance with the Support Schedule for a period of 1 year from the relevant Quotation Effective Date, or for such other period as expressly set out in the relevant Quotation.

## 4. Special Usage License

### 4.1

Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, a Special Usage License can be granted, purely at the Licensors discretion.

### 4.2

Without prejudice likely recipients of a Special Usage License will include:

(a) Students in full-time education;
(b) Charities and Non-Governmental Organisations
(c) Open Source Products

### 4.3

Requests for Special Usage Licenses must be made by email to admin@infinite-table.com

## 5. Charges, invoicing and payment

### 5.1

The Fees will be invoiced by the Licensor annually in advance upon the relevant Quotation Effective Date. Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, the Licensee must pay each valid invoice within 30 days of the date of the invoice.

### 5.2

Unless otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, all amounts referred to in these Terms are exclusive of value added tax ("VAT") which, where chargeable by the Licensor, shall be payable by the Licensee at the rate and in the manner prescribed by law. All other taxes, duties, customs or similar charges shall be the responsibility of the Licensor.

### 5.3

The Licensor will invoice, and the Licensee will pay invoices in the currency to be agreed between the parties and as set out in the relevant Quotation.

## 6. Warranties

### 6.1

The Licensor represents and warrants that:

(a) it has the right to enter into these Terms and to license the Licensed Materials and provide the Support Services (if any) as contemplated by these Terms;

(b) the Support Services (if any) shall be performed with reasonable care, skill and diligence;

(c) the Licensed Materials and Support Services (if any) shall comply with all applicable laws, regulatory requirements, mandatory standards and codes of practice of any competent authority for the time being in force;

(d) it shall not knowingly introduce into any the Software any computer software routine intended or designed to disable, damage, erase, disrupt or impair the normal operation of, or provide unauthorised access to or modification or monitoring of, any computer system or any software or information stored on any computer system, including viruses, worms, time bombs, time locks, drop-dead devices, access codes, security keys, back doors or trap door devices;

(e) the Software shall perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation for a period of 90 days after: (i) the first Quotation Effective Date; and (ii) the provision of a New Version in accordance with these Terms, provided that this warranty shall not apply to error or failure resulting from: (i) machine error; (ii) the Licensee's failure to follow operating instructions; (iii) negligence or accident by any person or entity other than the Licensor; or (iv) modifications to the Software by any person or entity other than the Licensor.

The Licensor provides the Licensed Materials on an "as is" basis and all warranties not expressly set out in these Terms, including any warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, are disclaimed to the fullest extent permitted by law.

### 6.4

The Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy for a breach of the warranty in clause 6.1(e) shall be to require the Licensor to repair the affected portion of the Software to ensure that it complies with the Documentation.
