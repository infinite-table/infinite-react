## Installation

```bash
npm install @infinite-table/infinite-react --save
```

## [Documentation](https://infinite-table.com/docs)

Our approach with the `InfiniteTable` is to go documentation first. From our developer experience we know that most software products lack a good documentation. So we want to be different and start with the documentation first since our purpose is to have an outstanding documentation that developers can actually use.

**[Visit API docs](https://infinite-table.com/docs)**

## ❤️ TypeScript

It's fully typed and offers you great developer experience to help you get up and running quickly

> The TypeScript typings file is included in the npm package - you don't have to download an additional **@types** package.

## 🎨 Themable

`Infinite Table` is fully customizable, via CSS variables. It ships with both a **light** and a **dark** theme - you have to import the CSS file from the package.

```js
import "@infinite-table/infinite-react/index.css"
```

This file includes both the light and the dark themes.


## Testing

Infinite Table is built with extensive end-to-end testing via headless chrome (more exactly, puppeteer).
