With the release of `<InfiniteTable />` <b>v5.0.0</b> we've added two new themes: `ocean` and `balsam`.

Now you have a selection of themes to choose from: `default`, `minimalist`, `ocean` and `balsam`.

To apply a theme, you have to set the className `"infinite-theme-name--THEME_NAME"` to any parent element of the `<InfiniteTable />` component (or even on the component itself).
