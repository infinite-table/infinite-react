We recently [announced the release of master-detail in the Infinite React DataGrid](/blog/2024/02/26/master-detail-now-available-in-react-datagrid), so we also made a video tutorial to follow along, if video is your preferred learning method.

This shows the very basics of configuring the Infinite React DataGrid with master-detail, and it's a great starting point for more advanced configurations.

You can find the full source code for the tutorial in the code sandbox below.

This example is two levels deep, but the Infinite React DataGrid supports any number of levels of master-detail.
