## Free Usage

You can immediately download and use [Infinite Table from the NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@infinite-table/infinite-react) free of charge.

<Note>

When using Infinite Table for free, you have access to **all the features** of Infinite Table, but you will see a [Powered by Infinite Table](https://infinite-table.com) link in the table footer.

</Note>

You can use it for free in any product, but make sure the footer is always visible when Infinite Table is visible. For demo purposes, we don't show any license error for embeds in [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) - which are used throughout this demo site. Check the demo below to see the license footer in action.
