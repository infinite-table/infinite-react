title: Cell Selection
description: InfiniteTable DataGrid component supports single and multiple cell selection.
---


To use multi-cell selection, you need to configure the `<DataSource />` component with `selectionMode="multi-cell"` - see <DPropLink name="selectionMode" /> for details.

```tsx title="Configuring the selection mode"
<DataSource selectionMode="multi-cell" />

// can be "single-row", "multi-row", "multi-cell" or false
```

More docs coming soon.
