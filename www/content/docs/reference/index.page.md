## API objects

In addition, both those components expose an `API` object that can be used to imperatively interact with them. This is useful for very advanced use cases - as most of the time interacting with the component via its props declaratively will be enough.

Explore the `InfiniteTable` API which allows advanced interactions with the component, like scrolling to a specific cell, selecting rows and more.

</YouWillLearnCard>

<YouWillLearnCard title="DataSource API" path="/docs/reference/datasource-api">

Jump into the `DataSource` API, which allows advanced interactions with the data source, like editing & inserting data, fetching data, refreshing and more.

## Type Definitions

Infinite Table exports quite a lot of TS type definitions. See the dedicated page for guides and explanations to help you use them effectively.

<HeroCards>
<YouWillLearnCard title="Type Definitions" path="/docs/reference/type-definitions">

We export our type definitions in case you ever need them. In many cases, you won't need to import them explicitly, but you might find them useful in more advaced scenarios.
