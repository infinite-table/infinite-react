<Intro>

We're pleased to be part of the React community üôè.

Especially grateful to the React core team for all their hard work and to all the library developers out there who make other people's lives easier by their work.

</Intro>

With Infinite Table we want to bring our contribution to the React community specifically and to the frontend developer community more broadly. We want to enable developers push the limits of how they handle and display data.
