## React 

React was originally created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke). Today, React has a [dedicated full-time team working on it](https://reactjs.org/community/team.html), as well as over a thousand [open source contributors](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/AUTHORS).


## Documentation

We're grateful for the work done by the [team behind reactjs.org](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org) and the new React documentation found at [beta.reactjs.org](https://beta.reactjs.org/) - we've built our documentation on their excellent work üôè and we're grateful for that.
