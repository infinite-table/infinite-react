title: Client-side Filtering
---

The most common way to use filtering in Infinite Table is by configuring filters for columns (this works both for client-side and server-side filtering).

 If the DataSource <DPropLink name="data" /> property is a function (and not an array or a `Promise`), then the filtering will happen server-side by default.

<Note>

To force client-side filtering, you can explicitly set the <DPropLink name="filterMode">filterMode="local"</DPropLink> property on the `<DataSource />` component.

The possible values for this prop are:

 - `filterMode="local"` - filtering will happen client-side
 - `filterMode="remote"` - filtering will happen remotely and the <DPropLink name="filterValue" /> will be passed as a property to the parameter object sent to the <DPropLink name="data"/> function.

</Note>

## Showing the Column Filters

In order to show the column filter editors in the column headers, you need to specify either the uncontrolled <DPropLink name="defaultFilterValue" /> property or the controlled <DPropLink name="filterValue" /> version.

<Sandpack title="Client-side filtering in action">

<Description>

This example shows remote data with local filtering - it sets `filterMode="local"` on the `<DataSource />` component.

In addition, the `filterDelay` property is set to `0` for instant feedback.

</Description>

```ts file=basic-local-filter-example.page.tsx
```

</Sandpack>

<Note>

If you still want filtering to be enabled with the default functionality of using the <DPropLink name="filterValue" /> (or uncontrolled <DPropLink name="defaultFilterValue" />), but want to hide the column filter editors, you can set the <DPropLink name="showColumnFilters">showColumnFilters</DPropLink> property to `false`.

</Note>

## Using Filter Types


As already documented in the [Understanding Filter Types](./#understanding-filter-types) section, you can specify the types of the filters the `<DataSource />` will support, by using the <DPropLink name="filterTypes" /> property.

The default filter types are `string` and `number` - read the next section to see how you can add new operators to those filter types.

A filter type is basically a collection of operators available for a type of data. Each operator needs a name and a function that will be used to filter the data, when that operator is applied.

```tsx {4,10} title=Using_filter_types_for_filterValue
filterValue={[
  {
    field: 'firstName',
    filterType: 'string',
    operator: 'includes',
    filterValue: 'John'
  },
  {
    field: 'age',
    filterType: 'number',
    operator: 'gt',
    filterValue: 30
  }
]}
```

The above filter value specifies that there are 2 filters applied:
 * the `firstName` column applies a filter that will only match rows with `firstName` containining the string `John`
 * the `age` column has an additional filter, that will only match rows with `age` greater than `30`

If <DPropLink name="filterMode" /> is set to `local`, then the filtering will happen client-side, using the filtering functions specified by `includes` operator in the `string` filter type and the `gt` operator in the `number` filter type.

Here's a snippet of code from the `string` filter type showing the `includes` operator:

```tsx
operators: [
  {
    name: 'includes',
    components: { Icon: /* a React Component */ },
    label: 'Includes',
    fn: ({ currentValue, filterValue, emptyValues }) => {
      if (emptyValues.has(currentValue) || emptyValues.has(filterValue)) {
        return true;
      }
      return (
        typeof currentValue === 'string' &&
        typeof filterValue == 'string' &&
        currentValue.toLowerCase().includes(filterValue.toLowerCase())
      );
    },
  },
  //...
]
```

Let's now look at another example, of implementing a custom `salary` filter type.

For this, we override the `filterTypes` property of the `<DataSource />` component:

```tsx
const filterTypes = {
  salary: {
    defaultOperator: 'gt',
    emptyValues: new Set(['', null, undefined]),
    operators: [ /*...*/ ]
  }
}

<DataSource<Developer>
  filterTypes={filterTypes}
/>
```

<Note>

When you specify new <DPropLink name="filterTypes"/>, the default filter types of `string` and `number` are still available - unless the new object contains those keys and overrides them explicitly.

</Note>


<Sandpack title="Client-side filtering in action with custom filter type">

<Description>

The `salary` column has a custom filter type, with the following operators: `gt`, `gte`, `lt` and `lte`.

</Description>

```ts file=filter-custom-filter-type-example.page.tsx
```

</Sandpack>

### Customizing Default Filter Types


By default, the `string` and `number` filter types are available. You can import the default filter types like this:

```ts
import { defaultFilterTypes } from '@infinite-table/infinite-react';
```

If you want to make all your instances of `InfiniteTable` have new operators for those filter types, you can simply mutate the exported `defaultFilterTypes` object.


<Sandpack title="Enhanced string filter type - new 'Not includes' operator">

<Description>

The `string` columns have a new `Not includes` operator.

</Description>

```ts file=customised-default-filter-types-example.page.tsx
```

</Sandpack>


<Note>

When you specify new <DPropLink name="filterTypes"/>, the default filter types of `string` and `number` are still available - unless the new object contains those keys and override them explicitly.

</Note>



## Using a filter delay

In order to save some resources, filtering is batched by default. This is controlled by the <DPropLink name="filterDelay"/> prop, which, if not specified, defaults to `200` milliseconds. This means, any changes to the column filters, that happen inside a 200ms window (or the current value of <DPropLink name="filterDelay"/>), will be debounced and only the last value will be used to trigger a filter.

<Note>

If you want to prevent debouncing/batching filter values, you can set <DPropLink name="filterDelay"/> to `0`.

</Note>

<Note>

API calls to <ApiLink name="setColumnFilter"/> or <ApiLink name="clearColumnFilter"/> are not batched.

</Note>


## Using a filter function instead of the column filters

For client-side rendering, it's possible that instead of showing a column filter bar, you use a custom <DPropLink name="filterFunction" /> to filter the data.

In this case, the filtering will happen client-side ... of course ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
