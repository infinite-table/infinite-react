## Coming Soon

Column headers have the same level of customization as column cells - you can fully control what is being rendered and when. Here's a summary of the things you can do in the column header:

- customize the label of a column
- specify custom sort icon
- configure the menu icon
- configure the column selection chechbox (for columns configured to display a selection checkbox)
- customize the order of all of the above, and select which ones should be included
