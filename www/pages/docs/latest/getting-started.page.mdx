`Infinite Table` for `React` is published on the public npm registry, under the `@infinite-table/infinite-react` package.

## Installation

Install it by doing `npm i @infinite-table/infinite-react`

## Licensing

You can use `@infinite-table/infinite-react` in 2 ways:

- without a license, but it will include a `Powered by infinite-table.com` link in the table footer. This way you can use it for free in any product, but make sure the footer is always visible when Infinite Table is visible.
- with a license - requests for licence quotations and additional quotations must be made by email to admin@infinite-table.com. After purchasing, you will receive a `licenseKey` which you will provide as a prop when you instantiate Infinite Table. This will make the `Powered by infinite-table.com` footer go away.
