## What is Infinite?

Infinite Table is a React component for displaying virtualized tabular data. It helps you display huge datasets and get the most out of them by providing you the right tools to do so: 

* sorting
* [row grouping](/docs/latest/learn/grouping-and-pivoting/grouping-rows)
* [pivoting](/docs/latest/learn/grouping-and-pivoting/pivoting)
* aggregation
* ... and 🚀 lots 🎊 more 🎉


We strive for almost zero dependencies, thus keeping the bundle size small and your application secure.

## Installation

<TerminalBlock>
npm i @infinite-table/infinite-react
</TerminalBlock>

## ❤️ TypeScript

It's fully typed and offers you great developer experience to help you get up and running quickly

> The TypeScript typings file is included in the npm package - you don't have to download an additional **@types** package.

## 🎨 Themable

`Infinite Table` is fully customizable, via CSS variables. It ships with both a **light** and a **dark** theme - you have to import the CSS file from the package.

```ts
import "@infinite-table/infinite-react/index.css"
```

This file includes both the light and the dark themes.
