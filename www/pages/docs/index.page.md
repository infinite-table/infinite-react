## What is Infinite?

Infinite Table is a React component for displaying virtualized tabular data. It helps you display huge datasets and get the most out of them by providing you the right tools to do so: 

* sorting
* row grouping
* aggregation
* pivoting
* ... and 🚀 lots 🎊 more 🎉


We strive for almost zero dependencies, thus keeping the bundle size small and your application secure.

## Installation

<TerminalBlock>
npm i @infinite-table/infinite-react
</TerminalBlock>

## ❤️ TypeScript

It's fully typed and offers you great developer experience to help you get up and running quickly

> The TypeScript typings file is included in the npm package - you don't have to download an additional **@types** package.

## 🎨 Themable
