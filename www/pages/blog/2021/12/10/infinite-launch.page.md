Today we are announcing the first version (`0.0.7`) of `Infinite Table` ready to be used by beta users - you can take it from npm

<TerminalBlock>
npm i @infinite-table/infinite-react
</TerminalBlock>

We're thrilled by the work done by the whole team and this is the result of years of their combined experience and passion ðŸŽ‰!

### Future plans

We have big plans for the future of `Infinite Table` - first we want to finish the current react implementation and see it widely used and wildly successful and then we can move on to other frontend libraries/frameworks.

The **virtualization engine** we've built for this component is library agnostic so we'll have to port the **rendering** part to other platforms - which could prove to be a not-so-difficult task with all the experience we have in building this.
